# 10701-ss-learning
Our final project for 10-701 (Machine Learning) where we used semi-supervised learning techniques on handwritten digits. The problem of identifying handwritten digits is well-studied in the supervised setting when the entire training set has labels. Our project is an approach to the problem in the semi-supervised setting -- when a small fraction (like 2-5%) of the datapoints have labels.
